Ways in which we use your data for advertising purposes
Ads keep our content FREE for everyone. Please note that by altering the settings below, you'll still receive ads, but these will not be personalised to you.
The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) describes online personalised advertising through the below definitions. We put contractual and/or technical restrictions to certain forms of advertising, to prevent your data from being collected and used elsewhere without your knowledge. For instance, as "Personalisation" requires a company to track your information from our websites, we tend to be more restrictive on this permission.
