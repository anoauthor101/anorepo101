How does it work?
Advertisers may collect data about your online browsing activity and use it to show you targeted ads (a process known as "behavioral advertising").
You can prevent the companies listed below from showing you targeted ads by submitting opt-outs. Opting-out will only prevent targeted ads so you may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) from these companies after you opt-out.
