Cookie usage policy
In the interest of transparency, this policy contains detailed information on France Médias Monde's use of cookies. This policy applies to all of the websites and mobile apps produced by France Médias Monde and explains how the User can control the use of cookies and other similar technologies.
By accessing the website, the User accepts the terms and conditions of this policy, applicable during each connection and from any terminal.
1. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that may be placed, depending on your preferences, in a dedicated area of your terminal (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) when you visit a website using your web browser. It enables the features of France Médias Monde, such as content recommendation, user authentication, and content submission. Its purpose is to collect information about the user's browsing and to transmit this information back.
When first connecting to the website, a banner is displayed on the first page. Subject to the User's choice, cookies will be stored in the memory of your computer, smartphone, tablet, mobile, etc. The collected information is used by the Websites or by a third party, such as an advertising agency or a partner of France Médias Monde. The cookie is kept for a maximum period of 13 (thirteen) months from the date on which the User grants consent to the integration of the cookie.
Users are free to delete them at any time on their terminal. They also have the option, at any time, of refusing the placing of cookies on their device via the browser and according to the procedure described in point 4 of this document.
However, the refusal of certain cookies may cause the degradation of a number of features required to browse the Websites (difficulties recording or displaying, etc.). In this case, France Médias Monde cannot be held liable as a result of these malfunctions. In addition, disabling advertising cookies does not mean that Users will not receive advertising but simply that they will no longer be adapted to their interests.
Users can also choose to view the site using the incognito mode offered by their browser; cookies will then be destroyed automatically when the window is closed. This can be a good alternative if the User wants to enjoy all the features of the Websites without the risk of sharing their browsing information beyond the duration of their visit.
2. What are cookies for?

Cookies are also necessary for the proper functioning of certain services or to measure the audience of its Websites.

If you refuse to have cookies placed on your terminal, you will no longer be able to benefit from some of the Websites' features, such as:
the deletion of social cookies: you will no longer be able to use the social sharing (like, share, comment, etc.) features (buttons and/or modules);
the deletion of advertising cookies: the ads displayed on the Websites will not take your interests or preferences into account and will be less relevant but deletion will not cause the advertising to stop.

5. Transferring data outside the European Union
Some of our partners are located outside the European Union. The data collected may therefore be transferred to countries outside the European Union which have different personal data protection legislation from those inside the European Union.
In this case, France Médias Monde implements the means to ensure the security and confidentiality of such data and ensures that the transfer meets the legal framework: the transfer to a country ensuring a sufficient level of protection, signature of contractual clauses issued by the European Commission, or any other regulatory or contractual means to ensure a sufficient level of protection.
Please note that we strictly require that our partners only use your personal data to manage or provide the services requested. We also ask these partners to always act in compliance with the applicable laws on personal data protection and pay particular attention to the confidentiality of such data.
